  text : The Southern Ocean (oceans south of 30°S) plays a key role in global biogeochemical cycles. But large environmental changes are ongoing in the Southern Ocean physical and biogeochemical properties. These changes reflect widespread environmental changes that are occurring throughout the southern hemisphere and over the Southern Ocean (changes in surface winds, solar radiation, sea ice cover and glacial melt from Antarctica). How the Southern Ocean primary production and carbon cycle will respond to these changing climate stressors is a matter of concern in the climate science community.

  text : Turbulent ocean models spontaneously generate a chaotic variability reaching multi­decadal/basin scales. How this low­-frequency chaos impacts climate-relevant oceanic indices is an important unsettled question. To separate this chaos from the atmospherically-forced response, MEOM and CERFACS have performed a pioneering 50-member ensemble of 1/4° global ocean/sea-ice simulations (1960-2015), which were perturbed initially but driven by the same atmospheric evolution. The results reveal the importance of the oceanic chaos, its large spatiotemporal scales, its its modulation by the atmosphere, and raise new issues about the detection/attribution of climate change in the ocean and the potential impact of this low-frequency chaos on the atmosphere.

  text : DRAKKAR is a scientific and technical coordination between French research teams (LGGE-Grenoble, LPO-Brest, LOCEAN-Paris), MERCATOR-ocean, NOC Southampton, IFM-Geomar Kiel, and other  teams in Europe and Canada. We propose to design, carry out, assess, and distribute high-resolution global ocean/sea-ice numerical simulations based on the NEMO platform (www.nemo-ocean.eu) performed over long periods (five decades or more), and to improve and maintain a hierarchy of state-of-the-art ocean/sea-ice model configurations for operational and research applications.

  text : The vision of AtlantOS is to improve and innovate Atlantic observing by using the Framework of Ocean Observing to obtain an international, more sustainable, more efficient, more integrated, and fit-for-purpose system. Hence, the AtlantOS initiative will have a long-lasting and sustainable contribution to the societal, economic and scientific benefit arising from this integrated approach. This will be achieved by improving the value for money, extent, completeness, quality and ease of access to Atlantic Ocean data required by industries, product supplying agencies, scientist and citizens.
